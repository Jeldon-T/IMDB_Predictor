## IMDB Predictor

The overall goal of this project was to create a script to take in datasets from the IMDB movie database and use the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to try and predict the rating of a new movie given parameters such as actor(s), genre, and director. This is really my beginner's attempt in university to try and create a predictive model and learn how to manipulate data in R.
